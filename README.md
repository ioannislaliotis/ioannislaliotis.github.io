I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Peloponnese, and I maintain an Honorary Visiting Scholar position in the Department of Economics at City University of London.
In the past, I served as a Scientific Advisor in the Council of Economic Advisors at the Ministry of Finance, and I was a Lecturer and Programme Director of the MSc Health Economics in the Department of Economics at City University of London. Prior to joining City, I was a Researcher in the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics (LSE). I mainly work with microdata to provide answers to policy-related questions in the fields of applied labour economics and applied health economics.
